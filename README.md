# Political Tweet Tracking

The goal is to collect a meaningful repository of politically focused tweets from both historical data (twitter archives) as well as new data that is being produced (twitter api). The scope of the tweets are defined in a config file which can be updated at any time. 

Once tweets are collected, analysis on sentiemnt and distribution (to include spatial and temporal at the moment) will be run to define the online landscape of a topics discussion on twitter.
